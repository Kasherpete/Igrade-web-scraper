Overview
========

This module is a wrapper for `iGradePlus <https://igradeplus.com>`__, a
website for managing and viewing grades, assignments, announcements, and
many other things for your school. iGrade uses a web framework called
`Oorian <https://oorian.com/>`__ developed by **Corvus Engineering,
LLC.** that is data driven and highly dynamic. In fact, Oorian was
developed solely for iGradePlus and is not even available to the public
(yet).

Features
---------
Here are some of the features of
iGrade-Web-Scraper:

-  Getting assignments (all, upcoming, recent, or problematic)
-  Fetching announcements
-  Getting calendar events (all or upcoming)
-  Get comprehensive grade and class info
-  Attendance info
-  Much more, including account info and class performance

In some cases, this module may help you get more information than using
the iGrade website itself!
