Overview
========

This module is a wrapper for `iGradePlus <https://igradeplus.com>`__, a
website for managing and viewing grades, assignments, announcements, and
many other things for your school. iGrade uses a web framework called
`Oorian <https://oorian.com/>`__ developed by **Corvus Engineering,
LLC.** that is data driven and highly dynamic. In fact, Oorian was
developed solely for iGradePlus and is not even available to the public
(yet).

Features
---------
Here are some of the features of
iGrade-Web-Scraper:

-  Getting :doc:`assignments <getting_assignments>` (all, upcoming, recent, or problematic)
-  Fetching :doc:`announcements <getting_announcements>`
-  Getting :doc:`calendar events <getting_events>` (all or upcoming)
-  Get comprehensive :doc:`grade <getting_grades>` and :doc:`class <teacher_info>` info
-  :doc:`Attendance info <attendance>`
-  Much more, including :doc:`account info <account_info>` and :doc:`class performance <performance>`

In some cases, this module may help you get more information than using
the iGrade website itself!
