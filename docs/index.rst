Welcome to iGrade-Web-Scraper's documentation!
==============================================

This module provides an easy and simple way of accessing information from your `iGradePlus <https://igradeplus.com>`_ account
and using it programmatically within your own python projects. There is a lot to cover, so we will try to do our best
to explain everything you need to know in order to use this rich and feature-filled module.

Check out the :doc:`overview` section for a quick explanation of our project, and :doc:`installation` to see exactly
what needs to be done in order to install properly.
