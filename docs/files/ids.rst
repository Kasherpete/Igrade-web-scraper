What are IDs?
=============

.. _ids:

An ID stand for identification, which is used to *“identify”* certain
resources, such as assignments, announcements, events, etc. For example,
when you go to your assignments page and click on an assignment, the URL
at the top will contain
``https://igradeplus.com/student/assignment?id=`` followed by the
assignment “ID”.

IDs are assigned to but not limited to:

-  :doc:`Assignments <getting_assignments>`
-  :doc:`Attachments <attachments>`
-  :doc:`Teachers <teacher_info>`
-  Classes
-  :doc:`Assignments <getting_events>`

You will see this being used a lot throughout using this module, and may
use it if you so need to. Many functions such as ``get_event_content``
and ``download_attachments`` use this feature.
