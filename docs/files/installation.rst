Installation
============

The iGrade-Web-Scraper module is not currently enrolled in
`Pypi <https://pypi.org/>`__, although it will be in the near future.
For now we will have to manually install from Github.

git clone
---------

1. Navigate to your project from the command line, and go to the folder
   you would like the project to be located in.
2. Type
   ``git clone https://github.com/Kasherpete/Igrade-web-scraper.git``
   into the prompt, and wait for the installation. This should only take
   a few seconds.
3. You should now see the project folder in your workspace, if you do,
   you are ready to start using the module!

Github CLI
----------
If you have
the `Github’s Official CLI <https://cli.github.com/>`__ installed,
you can install that way if you want to. Type
``gh repo clone Kasherpete/Igrade-web-scraper`` and follow the steps
above for moving the module into your project folder.

Installing Manually
-------------------
If you would like to install everything manually or you
don’t want to deal with issues with git or Github, follow these
steps:

1. Download the zip file `here <https://github.com/Kasherpete/Igrade-web-scraper/archive/HEAD.zip>`_

   .. raw:: html

      <script async defer src="https://buttons.github.io/buttons.js"></script>
      <a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/Kasherpete/Igrade-web-scraper/archive/HEAD.zip" data-icon="octicon-download" data-size="large" aria-label="Download Kasherpete/Igrade-web-scraper on GitHub">Download</a>
      <p></p>

2. Extract the contents of the file. You can do this on a Mac by double
   clicking on the file, and you can do it on windows by right clicking
   and pressing “extract all”. You may need an external program in order
   to properly unzip the file.

3. Move the file to the project directory. You can do this via File
   Explorer or Finder, or using the command line if you so wish.

Congratulations! You are now able to use the module and continue with
the guide.
